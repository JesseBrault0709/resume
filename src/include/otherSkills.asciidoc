== Other Skills

* *Server Administration*: I maintain a personal virtual private server at https://digitalocean.com/[digitalocean.com]
running Ubuntu, where I host a variety of services and websites. Tasks I often do include:
package administration, system updates, continuous integration, security maintenance,
configuring `apache`, updating TLS certificates, automating repetitive tasks, and so on.

* *Web and App Design*: I have an unfinished design at Figma for _The Pantry App_.
